Iâ€™m Jose Tovar.

After earning my certificate in web development from online courses and being self taught, I entered the freelancer world to explore my passion for frontend with frameworks as **Angular and React**, backend with **NodeJS, ExpressJS, NestJS, Flask, FastAPI** and full stack web apps using programming languages like **JavaScript, TypeScript and Python.**

Iâ€™ve spent the last 4 years learning everything there is to know about the web development industry from backend to deployment.

Iâ€™m always happy to connect with new people and discuss their projects. Shoot me a message â€“ I look forward to hearing from you!
